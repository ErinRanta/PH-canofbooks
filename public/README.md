## Team agreement

Logistical:

We have agreed that we will meet at the beginning of the lab time and at the end to discuss. Also to work together during those times.

We will communicate via slack.

If we fall behind, we will communicate with each other on ways to pick it back up (i.e. stay up late).

Cooperative:

Strengths List, and how do we utilize each of our strengths.

What areas do we want to ggain greater strength (for me, practice!! be more comfortable with the code).

During our meeting times we will go over our own code and this wil be a time to explain to each other if one does not understand.

Conflict Resolution:

Communication and respect.
